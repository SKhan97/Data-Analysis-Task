# Data-Analysis-Task
Given a set of data (Customer ID, number of logins per day and company type), the task was to analyse and see what is the difference between companies that subscribe and don't. Then to build a model that can predict whether a customer will subscribe after a free trial or not.

The data was given in a .log file so first I had to create a file that converted it into the appropriate format. Then I created a dataframe for all the features and calculated relevant quantities (correlation matrix etc.). After this, I built a model which could predict if a customer would subscribe after their free trial or not with an accuracy of 96%.
